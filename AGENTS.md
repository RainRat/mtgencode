Run the test suite before completing work. When features change, update or add tests accordingly.

testdata\Standard.json contains data of cards in Standard, downloaded from mtgjson.com as a preview of the full data of cards in Vintage. Still it is 34MB, so don't try to load the whole thing into LLM context, nor create a test that involves verifying every value. You can still have a test that loads it into memory, or pulls specific items from it.
